# Slot Machine Game
This is just a silly game I made while learning Ruby for the first time.

To play:
- Copy the two files to any directory.
- Open a Terminal Command window.
- Direct it to the directory which you saved the files.
- Type "ruby gamble.rb"

The animation file does not run, it simply is used within gamble.rb

Recommend you run this in a 125x65 Terminal Screen.
